*I'm taking problems from Kishor S. Trivendi's 1982 book and creating 
solutions using LaTeX typesetting. 

*Here's the outline of my work so far:

-prob-template.tex is a general template for solutions.
-Example-1.1.tex is the solution to Example 1.1.
-Problem-1A.tex is the solution to part of problem 1
-Problem-1B.tex is the solution to second part of problem 1
-Problem-1C.tex is the solution to third part of problem 1
