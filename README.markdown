## I'm taking problems from Kishor S. Trivendi's 1982 book and creating solutions using LaTeX typesetting. 

### Here's the outline of my work so far:
  * prob-template.tex is a general template for solutions.
  * Example-1.1.tex is the solution to Example 1.1.
    * [Example-1.1 PDF solution](http://www.algorithmsanonymous.com/sites/default/files/Example-1.1.pdf)
  * Problem-1A.tex is the solution to part of problem 1
    * [Problem-1A PDF solution](http://www.algorithmsanonymous.com/sites/default/files/Problem-1A.pdf)
  * Problem-1B.tex is the solution to second part of problem 1
    * [Problem-1B PDF solution](http://www.algorithmsanonymous.com/sites/default/files/Problem-1B.pdf)
  * Problem-1C.tex is the solution to third part of problem 1
    * [Problem-1C PDF solution](http://www.algorithmsanonymous.com/sites/default/files/Problem-1C.pdf)
