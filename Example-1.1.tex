\section{Example 1.1 Problem}
\emph{Consider an example of a computer system with five identical tape drives. One possible random experiment 
consists of checking the system to see how many tape drives are currently available. Each tape drive is in one of 
two states: busy (labeled 0) and available (labeled 1). An outcome of the experiment (a point in the sample space) 
can be denoted by a 5-tuple of 0's and 1's. A 0 in position i of the 5-tuple indicates that tape drive i is busy and 
a 1 indicates that it is available. The sample space has $ 2^{5}=32 $ sample points, as shown in the table on page 8. 
Assume that we are required to determine the probability that a process is scheduled for immediate execution, given 
that the process needs at least three tape drives for its execution.} [Trivendi, 1982]
\subsection{Step 1: (Identify the sample space S)}
$ S = \{s_{0}, s_{1}, s_{2},..., s_{31}\} $, with $ s_{0} = \{0,0,0,0,0\}, s_{1} = \{0,0,0,0,1\}, s_{2} = \{0,0,0,1,0\}, s_{3} = \{0,0,0,1,1\},..., s_{31} = 
\{1,1,1,1,1,\} $
\subsection{Step 2: (Assign probabilities)}
Because the problem statement doesn't specify a probability distribution, we assume that each $ s_{i} $ is 
equiproable with probability of 1/32.
\subsection{Step 3: (Identify the events of interest)}
E = "the probability that a process is scheduled for immediate execution, given that the process needs at least 
three tape drives for its execution." \newline
$ E = \{(0,0,1,1,1), (0,1,0,1,1), (0,1,1,0,1), (0,1,1,1,0), (0,1,1,1,1), (1,0,0,1,1), (1,0,1,0,1), (1,0,1,1,0), 
(1,0,1,1,1), (1,1,0,0,1), (1,1,0,1,0), (1,1,0,1,1), (1,1,1,0,0), (1,1,1,0,1), (1,1,1,1,0), (1,1,1,1,1)\} $ \newline
$ E = \{s_{4}, s_{11}, s_{13}, s_{14}, s_{15}, s_{19}, s_{21}, s_{22}, s_{23}, s_{25}, s_{26}, s_{27}, s_{28}, 
s_{29}, s_{30}, s_{31}\} $
